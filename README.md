# Connect4GameCTG
Connect 4 is a tic-tac-toe with gravity played on a board with 6 rows and 7 columns. As the name implies, the goal is to get 4 in a row ( this can be vertically, horizontally, or diagonally). Checkers are dropped at the top of a column and fall until they reach the bottom or land on another checker.
